this project, i designed for my own personal use.
A friend told me he wanted one too, that it'd help keep track of his exploration around soulsborne games (for most info and stuff are written on item description).
Point is to catalog what you explore without needing to search for an answer, use notes to write speculations on any topic of the game(s) (i'll be adding more soon, perhaps even making one of my own)
So that you can check your own notes as a logbook instead of looking up answers. 
(i thought it'd be nice to have such raw experiences and so did this friend of mine. Hopefully it'd help some other people as well)
codes using CSS, JS, HTML, and a bit more. I'm still a beginner, had lots of help from online research, ai training me to do so etc.

if any of you have suggestions, complaints, or ideas in general that i can improve this very first project of mine, feel free to share your opinion with me.
